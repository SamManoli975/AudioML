sound analysis

waveform
>frequency
>intensity
>tombre


waveform can be 
periodic or aperiodic

if periodic then can be simple or complex

if aperiodic then can be continuous or transient


frequency is in hertz, is 1/period (reoccurance)
amplitude is how high it goes




how to speed up normally, why does the pitch increase?
how a 1d array after transform looks like when importing the audio, explain what fourier transform is
