we have a mixed signal of "y(t) = s1(t) + s2(t) + ... + sn(t)"
where each s is a source, (vocals, drums etc)
and i want to recover the individual sources from just the mixture


approaches
Spectral subtraction: Assumes sources occupy different frequency ranges
Blind Source Separation (BSS): Uses statistical independence assumptions
Matrix factorization: Decomposes the spectrogram into basis functions and activations

Advanced approaches:

Deep learning models: Learn complex mappings from mixtures to sources
Probabilistic models: Use probabilistic assumptions about source characteristics
